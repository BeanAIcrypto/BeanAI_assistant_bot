## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture:

The BeanAI_bot project is built using a modular architecture and includes the following key components:

1. **Bot Backend Logic**  
   - **Language**: Python  
   - **Telegram Framework**: `aiogram`  
   - **Structure** Core business logic is implemented as individual asynchronous event (`handlers`).
   - AI Integration **OpenAI API** (`openai`)  for generating intelligent, context-aware responses.

2. **Database Handling**  
   - **PostgreSQL** (via `psycopg2-binary`) ‚Äî Used for storing user data, message history, and interaction logs.  

3. **Integration with External Services**  
   - **Google API** (`google-api-python-client`) ‚Äî Integrates with Google Sheets for data input/output.  
   - **Graspil API** ‚Äî Processes target IDs and provides specific data lookups.  
   - **FAISS** ‚Äî  Enables high-performance vector-based search for efficient semantic text processing.

4. **Documents and Media Support**  
   - **Document Handling** (`python-docx`, `python-pptx`, `PyPDF2`) ‚Äî Process DOCX, PPTX, and PDF files.  
   - **Video/Audio Processing** (`ffmpeg`) ‚Äî Converts and processes various media formats.

5. **Data Parsing and Automation**  
   - **Playwright** ‚Äî Automates browser tasks and retrieves content from dynamic websites.  
   - **BeautifulSoup4** ‚Äî Parses and extracts structured data from HTML pages.

6. **Architectural Decisions**  
   - **Modular Code Structure**: All logic is divided into clearly defined modules (e.g.,`handlers`, `services`, `database`, `utils`) for maintainability and scalability..  
   - **Asynchronous Event Handling:**: Uses `asyncio` and `aiogram`  to manage non-blocking Telegram communication and concurrent operations.  
   - **Environment-Based Configuration** Project settings (API keys, tokens, DB credentials) are managed via `.env` files, allowing flexible deployment without modifying code.
